# Graduate Admission Classification
In this assignment, I studied and compared several key classifiers including Perceptron, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forests. I analyzed them based on criteria such as speed, robustness, suitability for different feature types, and whether they solve optimization problems. This comparison helped me understand their strengths and limitations, and which would be best to try first on a dataset.

Next, I defined various feature types—numerical, nominal, date, text, image, and dependent variables—and provided practical examples from datasets like Iris to illustrate them.

I researched alternative classifier performance metrics beyond accuracy, such as precision, recall, F1 score, and false positives. I described their mathematical formulas and their practical meanings, which deepened my grasp of evaluating classification models comprehensively.

Finally, I implemented from scratch a correlation matrix for the Graduate Admission dataset to analyze feature relationships without using built-in statistical functions. Through this, I explored which features most strongly correlate with the target variable (Chance of Admit) and gained insights into feature importance for predictive modeling.
