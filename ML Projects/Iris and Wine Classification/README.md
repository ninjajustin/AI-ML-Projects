# Iris and Wine Classification
In this assignment, I explored and analyzed two popular classification datasets: Iris and Wine. I started by defining key machine learning concepts such as training, testing, and validation datasets, ground truth, labels, preprocessing, features, decision surfaces, model validation, and overfitting. Next, I loaded both datasets using Scikit-learn, examined their size, feature types, categories, and computed basic statistics like the mean for numerical features.

Using visualization tools like Seaborn’s pairplot, I explored feature relationships in the Iris dataset and identified the features with the strongest separation power for classification. I also plotted subsets of features from the Wine dataset to better understand its structure.

Overall, this assignment deepened my understanding of fundamental machine learning terminology, dataset characteristics, and exploratory data analysis techniques essential for effective classification modeling.
