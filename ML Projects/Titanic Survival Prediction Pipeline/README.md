# Titanic Survival Prediction Pipeline
In this assignment, I developed a machine learning classification pipeline to predict Titanic passenger survival using the Kaggle Titanic dataset.

I started by preprocessing the data, which involved imputing missing values thoughtfully, encoding categorical variables, and removing irrelevant or redundant features that would not help prediction.

Using the cleaned dataset, I trained a classifier (such as a Random Forest) to model survival probability.

I then generated predictions on the test dataset and submitted the results to Kaggle, achieving an accuracy of approximately 79%, consistent with the baseline benchmark.

The project demonstrated practical data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training skills to solve a real-world binary classification problem, with the end goal of producing Kaggle-compatible prediction files for submission and evaluation.
