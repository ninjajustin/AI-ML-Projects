# Shortest Path in Grid World
In this assignment, I implemented the A* Search algorithm to solve navigation problems in a grid-based environment.
The world has various terrain types with different movement costs. The algorithm finds the most cost-efficient path from a start point to a goal, avoiding impassable terrain 
and minimizing total traversal cost. This models real-world applications like video game path finding using waypoints and heuristic-based search techniques.
