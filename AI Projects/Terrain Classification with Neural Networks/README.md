# Terrain Classification with Neural Networks
Built a feedforward neural network from scratch to classify terrain types (hills, swamp, forest, plains) based on 4×4 grayscale sensor images representing visual inputs from an agent's perspective. Implemented one-hot encoding for class labels and trained the model using backpropagation on synthetically generated image data. Evaluated model accuracy using error rates over training and test sets across varying hidden layer sizes (2, 4, 8 nodes). Conducted experiments to identify the optimal hidden node count for generalization. This assignment emphasized custom ANN design, data generation, and multi-class classification using the largest-output decision rule.
