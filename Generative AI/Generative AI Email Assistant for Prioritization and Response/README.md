# Generative AI Email Assistant for Prioritization and Response
In this project, I developed a generative AI system to help manage and prioritize a high volume of business emails using the Yesterbox approach. I created an executive dashboard summarizing yesterday’s emails by urgency and category, focused on critical emails requiring immediate attention, and generated AI-drafted response templates for these messages. To ensure quality, I implemented an “LLM as a Judge” evaluation to assess the relevance, clarity, and actionability of summaries and drafts. This tool streamlines email management, helping reduce manual effort and prevent missed critical communications.
