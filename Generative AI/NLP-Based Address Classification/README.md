# NLP-Based Address Classification
This project replicates a real-world address classification problem inspired by the USPS’s efforts to improve COVID test kit delivery. Using labeled address data, the goal was to train a machine learning model to automatically classify address service requests into meaningful categories. The process involved cleaning and preprocessing raw address text, converting it into TF-IDF features, and training a logistic regression model. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrices, with additional analysis of misclassified examples and suggestions for improvement.
