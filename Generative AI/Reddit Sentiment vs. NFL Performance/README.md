# Reddit Sentiment vs. NFL Performance
This project explores the relationship between public sentiment on Reddit during the NFL Draft and the future performance of drafted players. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, sentiment was extracted from Reddit threads, cleaned, and aggregated by player. VADER sentiment analysis was used to generate sentiment scores, which were then compared against player performance metrics. Visualizations and evaluation metrics (such as correlation and precision@k) were used to assess the predictive value of sentiment. The results offer insights into how social media sentiment may support sports analytics and draft strategy.
